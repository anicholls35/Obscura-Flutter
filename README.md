# Obsucra - Photo Based Social Media Platform
## *Status: In-Development -> Unpublished*

### About
Obscura is the idea and creation of the Lucky7 team for the 2020/21 Heriot-Watt Year 3 Group Project. Currently an ongoing project to produce a social media platform were proffesionals and hobbists can post images of objects to show their photography skills. Obscura is an object only platform, meaning that images can't contain any people (full or partial) in the images. Obscura will provide a gamified experience to allow user's to challenge eachother and showcase their images against eachother. Gamification can be done globally accross the app, or in select groups - called channels - were people with similar interests can interact and compete with eachother. 

Obscura will also use Geo-Location to allow images to be mapped to were they were taken. This data allows obscura as a platform to do geo-based challenges, aswell as allowing users to visit where these pictures were taken. (User's personal location is not uploaded). 

### Intended Platforms
Lucky7's goal is to have Obscura to be functional on both Android, iOS and Web by **1st April 2021** *(STC)*
